# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Project Description

The project's main objective was to create a daily schedule, allowing the user to fill in a list of objectives to do at a given time of the day. Depending on the time of day, the text box would change colour to grey, red and green for the past, present and future respectively, helping the user identify which is which. 

## Objectives

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
